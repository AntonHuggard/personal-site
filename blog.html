            <h4>12 RULES FOR WEB DESIGN</h4>

                Most websites are terrible. They make a bad first impression and are  
                poorly-designed. There are very few websites good websites out there.
                Obviously, if you want to attract traffic to your site, you should not 
                be annoying and user-hostile. 
                People are constantly looking for excuses to leave <em>your</em> site and go to
                one they're already familiar with. Don't give them any.
                Here are 12 rules to keep in mind.
            </p>
            <h3>1. DON'T FORCE USERS TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT.</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
                Unless you're gmail, netflix or youtube, no one wants to have an account with you.
                If there's something users can't do (that they want to) without an account, they'll leave. 
                Hitting a “log in to continue” message is an invitation to leave.
                <br>
                Beggars can't be choosers. If you want people to use your website, don't
                scare them away. Don't put up walls - you're acting against your best interests.

            </p>
            <h3>2. DON'T ASK FOR COOKIES.</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
                No one cares about your site. Most users have no intention of coming back.
                They want no relationship with your site. 
                <br>
                The average user probably doesn't fully understand what cookies are - so 
                asking makes your audience confused and suspicious. These requests
                are really annoying. In the old days of the internet, pop-ups were infuritating.
                Cookies are the new version of that.
                They're almost always unnecessary and are definitely not worth the negative
                response asking is likely to provoke. Don't ask for cookies.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Use human-friendly URLs</h3>
            <h3>3. MINIMISE CLICKING</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
                If someone is new to your site, they don't know whether they can trust it.
                If they're brave enough to go to one page (and it seems safe), you've got
                a foot in the door. If the page delivers what was promised, they'll be happy.
                If it doesn't, they will be angry and leave. <strong>DO NOT</strong> deliver
                <em>some</em> of what was promised - don't make users "click to see page 2" -
                they don't like being held hostage.
            </p>
            <h3>4. Don't put anything on a page that doesn’t need to be there.</h3>
            <h3>5. BE NORMAL.</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
                Most websites are more-or-less look the same. They follow familiar patterns.
                So, don't try and be clever. Deviations from the expected layouts are obstacles.  
                Website name (+ image) at the top or top-left.
                Search bar - if you have one - should be at the top too.
                Admin-y things at the very bottom of the page (with copyright information).
                If you are a company, put your “careers” link there.
                For anyone else, this is where social media links are expected


            </p>
            <h3>6. DON'T BE TACKY.</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
                Using a custom scrollbar or cursor is revolting. It's like
                gold-coloured plastic or a custom number-plate. 
                It's not impressive. 
                It's not fancy. 
                It's lame. If you feel the need to stand out with a scrollbar, you're
                over compensating for something (probably the fact that your site is 
                a waste of time).
                Also, using lots of GIFs is tacky.
