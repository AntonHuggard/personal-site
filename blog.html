        <h4>12 RULES FOR WEB DESIGN</h4>
        <h3>April 2022</h3>
        <p class="blog-p">
            Most websites are terrible. They make a bad first impression and are then 
            poorly-designed, slow or just <em>annoying</em>. There are very few websites 
            that are genuinely pleasant to use.
            Obviously, if you want to attract traffic to your site, you should not be user-hostile. 
            Here are 12 rules to keep in mind.
        </p>
        <h3>1. DO NOT USE COOKIES.</h3>
        <p class="blog-p">
            Very few first-time users care about your site. They have no intention of coming back.
            They want no relationship with your site. The average user probably doesn't even fully
            understand what cookies are - so asking for them probably makes them slightly confused 
            and suspicious. Cookies are usually unnecessary and definitely not worth the negative
            response asking is likely to provoke. Don't ask for cookies.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Use a sensible domain name</h3>
        <h3>3. Avoid walls of text</h3>
        <h3>4. Keep it simple</h3>
        <h3>5. Don't be tacky.</h3>
